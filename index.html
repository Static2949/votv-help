<!-- <a href=".">< Back to the main page</a><br><br> -->
Spoiler-free page, but mostly empty because I'm not that familiar with issues players may have.

<h1>I keep falling down!</h1>
Maybe stop sprinting down the hills? You would fall if you would do that in real life as well.<br>
You also may walk in zigzags, since paths like that would have less of a sharp angle.<br>
There is also some pieces of equipment that reduce fall damage and give you a better "grip" with the ground, which you can get
right from the start of the game for free. But this page is spoiler-free so, no further info for you.<br><br>

<h1>I keep getting lost!</h1><br>
Look at the huge map poster in the main room of your base.<br>
Remember the square shape of satellite positions around your base, and that they are placed in chronological order from top-left and go clock-wise
and that they use chronological alphabet.<br>
You may also get digital map from the store.<br>
Aaaaand you could get beacons to mark specific spots that you may want to revisit later, or simply are not able to remember.<br>

<h1>What upgrades should I buy?</h1>
In my opinion, the best one is the solar panel for your ATV. Though take note that it doesn't charge when you sit on it, and apparently doesn't charge
when its placed in shadows (or maybe in specific places? mine never charged if it was in the garage).<br>
For the control panel - one that lets you process signals to further levels (since you get more credits for "upgraded" signals),<br>
and stuff that affects speed, since it would you let "clean" signals faster.<br><br>

<h1>My Kerfur/Kerfur-O keeps getting stuck in the river!</h1>
Go to Keybinds (in settings), scroll down and set a hotkey for snow/winter mode<br><br>

<h1>Nails don't work!</h1>
Hold a nail (in hands), put it where you want things to connect - it would "freeze" in that position, then hit it with a hammer (or just buy the nailgun).<br>
If your nail falls off, or doesn't connect stuff, then there are two potential issues you may have:<br>
1. Try aiming it somewhere else (even a few pixels to the side could be sufficient), or change angle (again, just a bit of rotation could be sufficient).<br>
2. Objects have two "bodies" - one is a model mesh, basically, what you can visually see. Other is a collider - something that is invisible and
is used for collisions (player with object for example). Nails connect objects by their invisible colliders, but not visible mesh!<br>
Basically, imagine a cube, which would be mesh and which you can see, and a sphere inside it, which would be invisible collider.
So, if you would want to attach the cube to something - you would not be able to attach it by putting nails onto its corners.<br>
