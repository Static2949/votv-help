<i>Spoiler-free page intended for newbies. Mostly empty because I'm not really familiar with issues players may have.<br>
Actually, may not be spoiler-free, but all stuff that could be spoilery would be hidden under "SPOILER" (you need to click on it yourself).<br>
Stuff that you need to find would be spoilered, stuff that you can get from the store - not.</i><br>

<h1>I keep falling down!</h1>
Maybe stop sprinting down the hills? You would fall if you would do that in real life as well!<br>
You also may walk in zigzags, since paths like that would have less of a sharp angle.<br>
There is also some pieces of equipment that reduce fall damage and give you a better "grip" with the ground, which you can get
right from the start of the game for free.<br>

You may also want to buy a hook from the store, with which you can ascend/descend even vertical walls.<br><br>

<h1>I keep getting lost!</h1>
Look at the huge map poster in the main room of your base.<br>
Remember the square shape of satellite positions around your base, and that they are placed in chronological order from top-left and go clock-wise
and that they use chronological alphabet.<br>

You may also get digital map from the store.<br>
Aaaaand you could get beacons to mark specific spots that you may want to revisit later, or simply are not able to remember.<br>
You may also attach digital map (and even clock) to your ATV!<br><br>

<h1>What upgrades should I buy?</h1>
In my opinion, the best one is the solar panel for your ATV. Though take note that it doesn't charge when you sit on it, and apparently doesn't charge
when its placed in shadows (or maybe in specific places? mine never charged if it was in the garage).<br>
For the control panel - one that lets you process signals to further levels (since you get more credits for "upgraded" signals),<br>
and stuff that affects speed, since it would you let "clean" signals faster.<br><br>

<h1>I can't sleep!</h1>
Dr. Kel says he doesn't want to sleep right now, and you also can't save your game?<br>
That means that one of the many game events is currently happening.<br>
For situations when you can't sleep because of this, and you're also low on stamina:<br>
Get a few coffee-chocolate-bars, or even better - get a coffee machine.<br>
With these, you can restore your stamina without needing to sleep.<br>

<h1>My Kerfur keeps getting stuck in the river!</h1>
Go to Keybinds (in settings), scroll down and set a hotkey for snow/winter mode.<br>
That will turn river into ice, allowing him, you, and even your ATV to simply slide across it.<br>
Whenever you send out Kerfur to do things, you should enable winter mode - he will cross the ice instead of getting stuck and drowning.<br><br>

<h1>Nails don't work!</h1>
Hold a nail (in hands), put it where you want things to connect - it would "freeze" in that position, then hit it with a hammer (or just buy the nailgun).<br>
If your nail falls off, or doesn't connect stuff, then there are two potential issues you may have:<br>
1. Try aiming it somewhere else (even a few pixels to the side could be sufficient), or change angle (again, just a bit of rotation could be sufficient).<br>
2. Objects have two "bodies" - one is a model mesh, basically, what you can visually see. Other is a collider - something that is invisible and
is used for collisions (player with object for example). Nails connect objects by their invisible colliders, but not visible mesh!<br>
Basically, imagine a cube, which would be mesh and which you can see, and a sphere inside it, which would be invisible collider.
So, if you would want to attach the cube to something - you would not be able to attach it by putting nails onto cube's corners.<br><br>

<h1>I want to take a lot of things...</h1>
<i>"I want to take a lot of things to my base, but I can't put these things into my inventory - I can only grab or hold them, and I don't want to run back-and-forth!"</i><br>
You can attach these things to your ATV using hooks, although driving it would be quite frustrating. Time-saving, though!<br>
You can also nail these things to your ATV, but that would be even more frustrating, and you would need to drive veeeery slowly.<br><br>

<h1>Running low on scrap!</h1>
Shoveling trashpiles (these piles that connect to ground whenever they touch ground) - would provide you with pile-specific resources.<br>
You can also dig various items from the ground, but you would need a metal detector to find these spots.<br>
Sometimes you get trash from which you can craft scrap, or you could try disassembling an item.<br>
You could also try buying items just to disassemble them.<br>

<h1>Can't get a big/heavy item back to its position!!!</h1>
<i>Putting back a fallen cabinet is easy. Moving fallen cabinet around is easy as well.<br>
But actually both putting it, for example, to a corner, and making it stand, instead of lying on the floor?</i><br>
- Grab and move that object as close as to where you want it to be.<br>
- Lift it up (to intended vertical position).<br>
- Take another object - trashpile, gas can, toolbox - anything that could have weight - and gently push that cabinet with it.<br>


<h1>Best items?</h1>
Best items, as in, a combination making your life easier and easy to acquire.<br>
All of them are buyable from the store:<br>
Sleeping bag/bedroll - you can place it near your console so you wont need to run to second floor when you need to sleep.<br>
Coffee machine - charges your stamina without needing to sleep. Don't overconsume it though.<br>
Solar panel module for ATV - (almost) never run out of fuel!.<br>
Hook - ascend and descend even most extreme hills and walls.<br>
Kerfur - better buy it and see what it does yourself.<br>

<h1>Cheating</h1>
You don't actually need to read what satellites you need to get hash codes from by reading the emails:<br>
Just open any page (doesn't matter if it's a single sheet or a diary) and press "hashcodes template" (or something like that) in top-right.<br>

<h1>How to farm</h1>
(in 0.8.2) You don't need to farm at all I wouldn't consider farming to be even a basic feature (you might've seen "farming pot (mushrooms only)" in the store),
so I wouldn't recommend even looking into it.<br>
