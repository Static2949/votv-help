<!-- <a href=".">< Back to the main page</a><br><br> -->
Spoiler-free page, but mostly empty because I'm not that familiar with issues players may have.<br>
Actually, may not be spoiler-free, but all stuff that could be spoilery would be hidden under "SPOILER" (you need to click on it yourself).<br>
Stuff that you need to find would be spoilered, stuff that you can get from the store - not.<br>

<h1>I keep falling down!</h1>
Maybe stop sprinting down the hills? You would fall if you would do that in real life as well!<br>
You also may walk in zigzags, since paths like that would have less of a sharp angle.<br>
There is also some pieces of equipment that reduce fall damage and give you a better "grip" with the ground, which you can get
right from the start of the game for free.<br>

        <details><summary><b>Motohelmet</b></summary>
            On the rocks near Whiskey. You may need a hook to reach it safely.<br>

You may also want to buy a hook from the store, with which you can ascend/descend even vertical walls.<br><br>

<h1>I keep getting lost!</h1>
Look at the huge map poster in the main room of your base.<br>
Remember the square shape of satellite positions around your base, and that they are placed in chronological order from top-left and go clock-wise
and that they use chronological alphabet.<br>

You may also get digital map from the store.<br>
Aaaaand you could get beacons to mark specific spots that you may want to revisit later, or simply are not able to remember.<br>
You may also attach digital map (and even clock) to your ATV!<br><br>

<h1>What upgrades should I buy?</h1>
In my opinion, the best one is the solar panel for your ATV. Though take note that it doesn't charge when you sit on it, and apparently doesn't charge
when its placed in shadows (or maybe in specific places? mine never charged if it was in the garage).<br>
For the control panel - one that lets you process signals to further levels (since you get more credits for "upgraded" signals),<br>
and stuff that affects speed, since it would you let "clean" signals faster.<br><br>

<h1>My Kerfur/Kerfur-O keeps getting stuck in the river!</h1>
Go to Keybinds (in settings), scroll down and set a hotkey for snow/winter mode.<br>
That will turn river into ice, allowing him, you, and even your ATV to simply slide across it.<br>
Whenever you send out Kerfur to do things, you should enable winter mode - he will cross the ice instead of getting stuck and drowning.<br><br>

<h1>Nails don't work!</h1>
Hold a nail (in hands), put it where you want things to connect - it would "freeze" in that position, then hit it with a hammer (or just buy the nailgun).<br>
If your nail falls off, or doesn't connect stuff, then there are two potential issues you may have:<br>
1. Try aiming it somewhere else (even a few pixels to the side could be sufficient), or change angle (again, just a bit of rotation could be sufficient).<br>
2. Objects have two "bodies" - one is a model mesh, basically, what you can visually see. Other is a collider - something that is invisible and
is used for collisions (player with object for example). Nails connect objects by their invisible colliders, but not visible mesh!<br>
Basically, imagine a cube, which would be mesh and which you can see, and a sphere inside it, which would be invisible collider.
So, if you would want to attach the cube to something - you would not be able to attach it by putting nails onto its corners.<br><br>

<h1>I want to take a lot of things...</h1>
<i>"I want to take a lot of things to my base, but I can't put these things into my inventory - I can only grab or hold them."</i><br>
You can attach these things to your ATV using hooks, although driving it would be quite frustrating. Time-saving, though!<br>
You can also nail these things to your ATV, but that would be even more frustrating, and you would need to drive veeeery slowly.<br><br>

<h1>Running low on scrap!</h1>
Shoveling trashpiles (these piles that connect to ground whenever they touch ground) - would provide you with pile-specific resources.<br>
You can also dig various items from the ground, but you would need a metal detector to find these spots.<br>
Sometimes you get trash from which you can craft scrap, or you could try disassembling an item.<br>
You could also try buying items just to disassemble them.<br>
